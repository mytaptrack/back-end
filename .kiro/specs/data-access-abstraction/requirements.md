# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a database abstraction layer that allows the MyTapTrack system to seamlessly switch between MongoDB and DynamoDB as the underlying data storage solution. The abstraction layer will provide a unified interface for data operations while maintaining the existing functionality and performance characteristics of the current DynamoDB implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified data access interface, so that I can write database operations without being tied to a specific database technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls a data operation THEN the system SHALL execute the operation through a common interface regardless of the underlying database
2. WHEN switching between MongoDB and DynamoDB THEN the application code SHALL NOT require changes to business logic
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide consistent method signatures across both database implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the database provider at runtime, so that I can switch between MongoDB and DynamoDB without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read the database provider configuration from environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN the database provider is set to "mongodb" THEN the system SHALL initialize MongoDB connections and use MongoDB-specific implementations
3. WHEN the database provider is set to "dynamodb" THEN the system SHALL initialize DynamoDB connections and use DynamoDB-specific implementations
4. IF an invalid database provider is specified THEN the system SHALL throw a configuration error with clear messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data models across database providers, so that my application logic remains unchanged regardless of the underlying storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored in MongoDB THEN it SHALL be transformed to match the expected application data model
2. WHEN data is retrieved from DynamoDB THEN it SHALL be transformed to match the expected application data model
3. WHEN performing queries THEN the abstraction layer SHALL handle database-specific query syntax internally
4. WHEN handling relationships THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide consistent relationship handling across both databases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction support across both database providers, so that I can maintain data consistency in complex operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a transaction THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide transaction support for both MongoDB and DynamoDB
2. WHEN a transaction fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes consistently across both database implementations
3. WHEN committing a transaction THEN all changes SHALL be persisted atomically in the underlying database
4. IF the underlying database doesn't support transactions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot database issues effectively regardless of the provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with consistent formatting across both providers
2. WHEN an operation fails THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide normalized error messages that don't expose database-specific details
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed database-specific information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms where appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and metrics, so that I can optimize database operations across different providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL collect timing metrics for each operation
2. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide consistent performance metrics across both database providers
3. WHEN operations are slow THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings with operation details
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the metrics SHALL be available in a standardized format regardless of the underlying database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration utilities, so that I can move data between MongoDB and DynamoDB when switching providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from DynamoDB to MongoDB THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to export and transform data appropriately
2. WHEN migrating from MongoDB to DynamoDB THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to export and transform data appropriately
3. WHEN performing migrations THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity after the migration process
4. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support, so that I can validate database operations work correctly with both providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support test database configurations for both MongoDB and DynamoDB
2. WHEN setting up test data THEN the abstraction layer SHALL provide consistent test data seeding across both providers
3. WHEN cleaning up after tests THEN the system SHALL provide consistent cleanup mechanisms for both database types
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN the tests SHALL be able to run against either database provider without modification
