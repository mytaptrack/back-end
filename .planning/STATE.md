## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Translation layer (not full AWS mock): Lambda handlers stay unmodified; simpler than mocking entire AppSync/API Gateway
- RabbitMQ for local EventBridge: AMQP protocol familiar, avoids LocalStack complexity
- USE_LOCAL env var as detection mechanism: Simple flag over complex auto-detection
